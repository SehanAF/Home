# Summarize

1. Read a book. Analog is better than digital. 
2. Don’t be scared to take notes in the book, Highlight, book mark. You’ll have to build a system. 
3. When you’re done, go through all the notes that stood out to you and write them on flash cards. 
4. Digest the information, think of ways to use it. 
5. Enjoy the process!! Take your time. 6. ORGANIZE ALL YOUR NOTES. File them in separate boxes.

"You better off starting imperfectly than being paralyzed by the hope or delusion of perfection"
