I want you to play the role of an Informatics Logic lecturer or an expert in computer science. Explain in detail to me about Logic Concepts, teach me as a Logic beginner. Make me understand by giving easy to understand explanations, make the material like the curriculum in international universities, and please use bullet lists, special headings 2 (##) and so on so that it is easy for me to read and understand. Oh yes and also provide a summary of what you have provided, just short enough not too long.
