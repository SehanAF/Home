## Reflection on the Importance of Lifelong Learning in the Context of Academic English

First, it is important to identify the scope of lifelong learning used in this study. The concept of lifelong learning has become a global trend (Head, Van Hoeck, & Garson, 2015).  Through deliberate learning efforts. Individuals who pursue lifelong learning consciously take steps, and they live by basic principles scommunicate effectively in academic English in a variety of contexts, such as lectures, seminars, and written assignments.

Lifelong learning is the ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge and skills throughout one's life. (Harmer, 2001, p. 10). This is particularly important in the context of academic English, as this language is essential for success in higher education and many professional fields.

Academic English is a complex and nuanced language that requires a high level of proficiency in grammar, vocabulary, and writing skills. (Hyland, 2006, p. 1). It is also important to be able to communicate effectively in academic English in a variety of contexts, such as lectures, seminars, and written assignments.

Lifelong academic English learning has a number of benefits, including intellectual growth, professional success and increased self-confidence." (Richards & Schmidt, 2002, p. 25). For me it can help me in reading academic journals, books in my field which is informatics, as well as taking online courses, reading books, and reading novels. 

Learning lifelong academic English has a number of benefits, including:

- Intellectual growth: By learning new vocabulary and grammatical concepts, as well as practicing different writing styles, I can develop critical thinking skills and become a more effective communicator.

- Professional success: Academic English is essential for success in my professional field of Information Technology. By developing my academic English skills, I can improve my job prospects and advance my career abroad, especially my goal of going to the United States.

-  Increase self-confidence: By becoming more proficient in academic English, I can feel more confident in my ability to communicate effectively in a variety of situations.

In conclusion, lifelong learning of academic English is essential for intellectual growth, professional success and increased self-confidence. By committing to ongoing language development, I can set myself up for success in my academic and professional journey.

Here are some tips for committing to a lifetime of academic English learning from me:

- Set realistic goals: Don't try to learn everything at once. Set small achievable goals for yourself, like I used to learn new vocabulary by reading novels or books. Then to practice my writing skills, I always rewrite an article about Technology into a book. I do that every day by setting aside at least 1 hour for it.
- Find a fun way to learn: There are many ways to learn academic English. For me, I always like to watch movies especially the tv series I'm watching right now is Drive to Survive. Then listen to podcasts on Spotify about habits and learning. Then now I also often study on Duolingo, it is the best learning app in my opinion.
- Find a study community: For me, it was to join an English club at university soon, so that I could have friends to practice and study with. Then I also have some online courses on MySkill and Udemy to help me stay motivated and on track.
