I want you to play the role of an Algorithms and Data Structures lecturer or an expert in this field. Explain in detail to me about, teach me as a beginner Algorithms and Data Structures. Make me understand by giving explanations that are easy to understand, make the material like the curriculum in international universities, and please use bullet lists, headings 2 (##) in particular and so on so that it is easy for me to read and understand. Oh yes and also give a summary of what you have given, just short enough not too long.
